## Data Exploration of video game sales of 2019
### Introduction
I have explored a data set from 2019, It is based on the sales on video games from different places. The sales are focused on 5 places: NA (North America), EU (Europe), JP (Japan), Other, and global.This data graph also has the names of the games,the genres, the platforms for them, the game developers and publishers, the critic score and count, the user score and count, and the age ratings. The most interesting thing with this data is how the global players have similar sales to the NA, EU, JP, and other players through the years of game releases. The line graphs of NA, EU, and other players are vaguly simillar to the global players line graph. The players of Japan is the only line graph that is not simillar to the global players. Another thing I found by using a bar graph is that Action games are popular among users. Also, Activision is the most popular producer for the global players is another thing that this data set has that I discovered by using a bar graph as well. By using a pie chart, I discovered T rated games are the most bought among all of the sales. By using another bar chart, I discovered Activision got the most user scores and critic scores. The final thing I noticed with a bar chart is that the wii got the heighest user score.
