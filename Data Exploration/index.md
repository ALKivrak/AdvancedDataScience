## Data Exploration of video game sales of 2019
### Introduction
  The Core discovery I made is that Activision is the most popular video game developer. My supporting arguments is that Activision got the most sales from different places, got the heighest critic and user score and count, and published the most games. One the side, I noticed that 505 games is in second or in third due to acclaim entertainment with sales, user and critic score and count, and publishing. I am interested in this data set because video games is my favorite subject.

### Initial Questions
  The desire to use a data set involving video games is what drove me to this data. I was about currious about what publisher got the most sales in different places, what publisher got the heighest critic and user score and count, and what publisher published the most games. What surprised me with this data is that there were several empty spaces in the user and critic score and count columns. This data set was easy to work with so there was no need to wrangle it.
