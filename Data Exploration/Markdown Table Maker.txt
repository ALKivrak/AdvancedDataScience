Markdown Table Maker

<body>
The code I created allows the user to create a markdown table from an excel spreedsheet.
The program first deletes the columns the user doesn't want by placing a # in the columns. 
Then, the program clears the cells the user doesn't want by placing a ! in the cells
Then, the program turns the hyperlinks the user doesn't need into normal text by placing a * in the cells containing the hyperlink
Finally, the program creates a markdown table in a text file named " MarkdownTable"using the remaining cells
Below is the link to the code I created
