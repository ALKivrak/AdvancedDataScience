## Markdown Table Maker
### How it works
The code I created allows the user to create a markdown table from an excel spreedsheet.
The program first deletes the columns the user doesn't want by filing the top cells of the columns with color index 37 (a shade of blue). 
Then, the program clears the cells the user doesn't want by filling those cells with color index 45 (a shade of orange).
Then, the program turns the hyperlinks into normal text the user doesn't want by filling those cells with color index 6 (pure yellow).
Finally, the program creates a markdown table in a file named "MarkdownTable" using the remaining cells.
