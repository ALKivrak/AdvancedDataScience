## Markdown Table Maker
### How it works
The code I created allows the user to create a markdown table from an excel spreedsheet.
The program first deletes the columns the user doesn't want by placing a # at the far left of any cells in the columns. 
Then, the program clears the cells the user doesn't want by placing a ! in the far left in the cells.
Then, the program turns the hyperlinks the user doesn't need into normal text by placing a * in the far left in cells containing the hyperlink.
Finally, the program creates a markdown table in a file named "MarkdownTable" using the remaining cells.
Below is the markdown table the code creates.
